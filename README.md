Nina Care Assessment
Background Info: For this assessment, we ask you to imagine you are working as Product Analyst. You have just been briefed on your newest assignment: Heads-up. The questions we are asking you are difficult to answer. Also for me, whilst I have all the context. Please give it your best-estimated guess! We just want to see how you think, don't worry about wrong or right.
